# Asheron’s Call Dungeon Builder

The Asheron’s Call Dungeon Builder is a work-in-progress tool designed for creating and editing dungeons within the world of Asheron's Call. It allows users to place terrain blocks using a grid-based system with X, Y, and Z axes, offering precise control over dungeon design while respecting the original game's data structures.

### Features
- **Grid-based terrain placement**: Snap terrain blocks together like Legos along the X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Copy and paste functionality**: Easily duplicate and modify existing sections of the world.
- **WorldBuilder functionality**: Intended to replicate and extend Turbine's original world-building tools.
- **Custom model support**: Use external programs like Blender to create custom GfxObj and Environment models.
